# Hangman

Table of Contents:
Project description: Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The project includes:
-creating a list of words that are later guessed
-collecting an input in form of a letter from the user
-writing a main loop assessing the input and printing a message to the user (in case of incorrect input)
-checking whether the letter is part of the word
-in case it is not: communicating it to the user, asking for repeting the action of providing the letter
